## Unity 3D FPS

Another class assignment, a FPS game where you have to shoot crabs on Mars.
* Character made using CharacterController.
* Both the player and the crab enemies have working health bars, and can take damage.
* The weapon can fire in two ways, continuously and snipe, the latter does more damage. Ammo gets deducted each time and can be reloaded or replenished using pickup items.
* The crab enemies are NavMesh Agents that cycle through 3 waypoints on the map, stopping at each of them for a period of time. If the player is in their view range they approach and inflict damage.
